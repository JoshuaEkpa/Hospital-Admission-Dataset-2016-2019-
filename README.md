# Hospital-Admission-Dataset-2016-2019-
This study applies Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to hospital admission records covering the period 2016–2019, with the objective of identifying statistically meaningful patterns in patient demographics, disease prevalence, and healthcare utilization. Using secondary administrative health data, key variables

📊 Dashboard Features & Analysis

1️⃣ Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

Total Number of Patients Admitted: 15.757K

Average Length of Stay: 6.42 days

These KPIs provide a quick summary of hospital utilization and patient care intensity.
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________
2️⃣ Age Group Analysis

The 60–73 age group recorded the highest number of admissions (~6.6K patients)

Admissions increase significantly from middle age and peak among elderly patients

Very low admission rates were observed among children (4–17) and extreme old age (102–115)

📌 Insight: Elderly patients represent the highest healthcare burden and require targeted resource planning.

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________
3️⃣ Gender-Based Outcome Analysis

Male patients: ~63.4% (9.99K)

Female patients: ~36.6% (5.77K)

📌 Insight: Male patients account for a significantly higher proportion of hospital outcomes, indicating potential gender-based health risks or healthcare-seeking behavior differences.
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________

4️⃣ Diagnosis & Medical Conditions

The most prevalent medical conditions include:

Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): 10,551 cases

Hypertension (HTN): 7,656 cases

Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS): 5,763 cases

Diabetes Mellitus (DM): 5,097 cases

📌 Insight: Cardiovascular-related diseases dominate hospital admissions, emphasizing the need for preventive cardiology programs.

________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 
5️⃣ Admission Trend by Year (DOA)

A sharp spike in recorded admissions was observed in 2016

Subsequent years (2017–2019) show minimal recorded values, suggesting possible data recording limitations or aggregation issues

📌 Insight: Data consistency checks are required for longitudinal trend analysis.

________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
6️⃣ Area Type Analysis

Urban Admissions: 50%

Rural Admissions: 50%

📌 Insight: Equal distribution suggests balanced access to healthcare services across regions.

_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 
🔍 Key Insights Summary

Elderly patients (60–73 years) are the most frequent hospital users

Male patients dominate admission outcomes

Cardiovascular and metabolic diseases are the leading causes of admission

Average hospital stay is relatively high (6.42 days), indicating moderate to severe case complexity

Equal rural–urban admission rates highlight wide healthcare reach
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________

📈 Recommendations

Increase geriatric-focused healthcare services

Strengthen cardiovascular disease prevention and management programs

Investigate data gaps in admission records across years

Optimize hospital bed management to reduce length of stay
